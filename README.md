# ADAMAS (Athletic Data Analytics & Management System)

![ADAMAS](https://via.placeholder.com/150x150.png?text=ADAMAS) 
*<!-- Replace with your own logo later -->*

ADAMAS is a full-stack web application designed for athletes, coaches, and sports managers to centralize training data, derive actionable insights, and build better training plans. It enables the ingestion, management, and analysis of heterogeneous sports data through a modern, data-centric platform.

This project serves as the capstone for my Computer Science studies and a cornerstone of my professional portfolio for data analytics and full-stack development roles.

## üöÄ Live Demo
